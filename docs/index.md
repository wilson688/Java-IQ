## Java Interview Questions  

My main intention is to get better at coding, to be a better teammate, to be a knowledgeable teammate one would wish for. 
I currently have good few years of experience but I still lack in terms of data structures and few java basics. Why I started this? 
I want to get better!!! 

I will be writing down few important java questions that are often asked in the interviews, trying to explain as much as possible.
